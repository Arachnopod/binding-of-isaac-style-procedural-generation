# binding-of-isaac-style-procedural-generation
Unity project for procedural generation similar to Binding of Isaac and the original Legend of Zelda. This repo goes along with a You Tube tutorial series.

The entire project is uploaded here, as well as two Unity packages, corresponding to it's state at the release of each of the tutorials.

There's two tutorials [the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nADIYwgKHv4) goes up to making a mini map version of the level and [the second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY4I5lMwf5I) takes it from there to creating the level.
